It's up to you to either have a wall blocking you site or have a simple card hidden away in a corner.

### Load pixel automaticly
Currently the pixels for Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Meta and LinkedIn are supported. You can also choose to load Google Tag Manager with Consent Mode v2 without any additional step.
